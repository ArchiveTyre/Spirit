# Cheri
A little compiler.
<br><br><br>

##### What is this?
> Nothing special. Just a little compiler that compiles to C++ code for portability.

##### What is implemented?
> Currently we can compile source into C++ code. Next step is import source files

A list of things that are implemented:
* Source to AST
* AST to C++
* Compiling multiple files
* A symbol table.

##### Why?
> Why not? (^.^)

## How to compile
Just type `make` from the project directory and see the magic as it happens ;).

## What do I need to compile this?
* clang
* make
* bison
* flex  
(Most of this should already be installed on your distro)

## Goals
* Minimalism
* Cute syntax
* High portability
* Speed?
